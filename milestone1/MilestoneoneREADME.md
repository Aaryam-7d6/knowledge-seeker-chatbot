## Milestone 1:
 ### Milestone 1 : Document Ingestion & Indexing
 - Objective: Build a robust data pipeline for processing and indexing documents.
 - Tasks: Select and set up a vector database; develop scripts for document ingestion and text splitting; generate and store document embeddings.

## Evaluation Criteria:
 - Milestone 1: The document ingestion and indexing pipeline is operational, and documents can be successfully embedded and stored in the vector database.
----
## Tooles use here:
 - Docker (for running database stably and Isolatedly)
 - Qdrant - Vector DB
 - Python
 - Embeddings (using HuggingFace)
 - LlamaIndex (for indexing)
 - Conda Environment

I use WSL (Ubuntu) here.
This supports docs, pdfs and txt files.
----
### New adds: 

 Add Logger and Metadata here.

 ### Next Step:
 - I try to add User i/p for path (files or directories) so system can use that.

I am currently experiencing with this approach, and maybe use other approach in future. Thank you have a fantastic day ahead :)
