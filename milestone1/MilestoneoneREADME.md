## Milestone 1:

 ### Milestone 1 : Document Ingestion & Indexing
 - Objective: Build a robust data pipeline for processing and indexing documents.
 - Tasks: Select and set up a vector database; develop scripts for document ingestion and text splitting; generate and store document embeddings.

## Evaluation Criteria:
 - Milestone 1: The document ingestion and indexing pipeline is operational, and documents can be successfully embedded and stored in the vector database.
----
## Tooles use here:
 - Docker (for running database stably)
 - Qdrant - Vector DB
 - Python
 - Embeddings (using HuggingFace)
 - LlamaIndex (for indexing)

I am currently experiencing with this approach, and maybe use other approach in future. Thank you have a fantastic day ahead :)
